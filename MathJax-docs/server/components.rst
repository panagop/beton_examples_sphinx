Using MathJax Components in Node
################################

**This page is still under construction.**

It is possible to use MathJax in a `node` application in essentially
the same was that it is used in a browser.  in particular, you can
load MathJax components and configure MathJax using a global
:data:`MathJax` object and loading the :ref:`startup-component`
component or a :ref:`combined component <combined-components>` file
via node's ``require()`` command.

See the `MathJax node demos
<https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-node#MathJax-demos-node>`__ for
examples of how to use MathJax from a `node` application.  in
particular, see the `component-based examples
<https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-node/tree/master/component#component-based-examples>`__
for illustrations of how to use MathJax components in a `node`
application.
  
More information will be coming to this section in the future.
