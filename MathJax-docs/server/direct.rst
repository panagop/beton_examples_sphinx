Linking to MathJax Directly in Node
###################################

**This page is still under construction.**

`Node` applications can link directly to MathJax source code, rather
than using :ref:`MathJax components <web-components>`.  This provides
the lowest-level access to the MathJax code, and is more complicated
than using components, but it gives you the greatest flexibility as
well.

See the `MathJax node demos
<https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-node#MathJax-demos-node>`__ for
examples of how to use MathJax from a `node` application.  in
particular, see the `non-component-based examples
<https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-node/tree/master/direct#non-component-based-examples>`__
for illustrations of how to use MathJax modules directly in a `node`
application, rather than using the pre-packaged components.
  
More information will be coming to this section in the future.
